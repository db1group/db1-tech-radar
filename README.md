# Tech Radar - DB1 Global Software 

## Overview

The DB1 Tech Radar is an overview of different technologies - from languages, frameworks, tools and patterns to platforms - that we consider "new or mentionable". The radar therefore doesn't provide an overview of all established technologies - but it focuses on items that have recently gained in importance or changed.

## Getting Started

To get started, you'll need to do the following:

1. Knowledge in markdown editors
2. Fork this repository
3. Clone the repository to your local machine
4. Run the project
5. Create a new branch for your changes
6. Make your changes to the Markdown files
7. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub
8. Create a pull request

## Development Setup

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) **version 16+**

After cloning the repo, run:

```bash

A high level overview of tools used:

- [React](hhttps://react.dev/) as the frontend framework
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for static error prevention (outside of types)
